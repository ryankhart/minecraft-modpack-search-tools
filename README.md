Make sure that Google Chrome is installed in the default location it picks on your PC.

Download and install ChromeDriver into a folder of your choosing.
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

Add the path to your ChromeDriver folder to your Windows path by doing the following:
- Open any File Explorer window.
- Right-click "This PC"
- Click "Properties"
- Click "Advanced system settings"
- Click the "Advanced" tab.
- Click "Environment Variables..."
- In the "System variables" pane, click the "Path" row.
- In the "System variables" pane, click the "Edit..." button.
- Click the "New" button.
- Type or paste the path you chose for your ChromeDriver location.
- Click "OK" when you are finished.

Note: ChromeDriver does not need to be already running in order for the script to work. The script will do that automatically.


```
python3 ./script.py
```
